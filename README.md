This application is a versioned released project for Full Sail that will meet iterations as time goes on.  The purpose of this app is to allow a user to input a URL and have a shortened URL generated for them.

##First Iteration
No web interface and just a simple static API.  The idea is to take the id generated by the database and convert it to an alphanumeric short number for a short URL.  However, since there is no database yet, this url ID is simply hardcoded as a query like so,

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/url/33909024
```

Which will return something like this:
```
{"short_url":"http://ur.l/3ZMYm","long_url_id":"33909024"}
```

Next phase, when we get the user's input URL and add it to a URL object in the DB, we can simply pull that ID dynamically and also return the user's original URL.

## Installation

- Clone the repo into your own directory using `git clone https://github.com/leesaenz/url-shortener.git
`.
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies

## Running the App

To run the application, run `npm start`.

In the next iteration, this will just use an npm command, from package.json

##Endpoints

Endpoints for the API are

- `GET /api/v1/url` to get your shortened URL back
