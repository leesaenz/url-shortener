#URL Shortener API

This application is a versioned released project for Full Sail that will meet iterations as time goes on.  The purpose of this app is to allow a user to input a URL and have a shortened URL generated for them.

##Versions

###v1 First Iteration: Static API
No web interface and just a simple static API.  The idea is to take the id generated by the database and convert it to an alphanumeric short number for a short URL.  However, since there is no database yet, this url ID is simply hardcoded as a query like so,

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/url/33909024
```

Which will return something like this:
```
{"short_url":"http://ur.l/3ZMYm","long_url_id":"33909024"}
```

Next phase, when we get the user's input URL and add it to a URL object in the DB, we can simply pull that ID dynamically and also return the user's original URL.

###v1 Second Iteration: Dynamic API
In this iteration, urls will be added, updated, read, and deleted from the database using the HTTP methods and endpoints in the Endpoints section below.

####GET
```
GET /api/v1/urls
```
```
Returns:
{
  "urls": [
    {
      "_id": "58c1d09fa28fa39cbd04db27",
      "longurl": "www.rottentomatoes.com",
      "shorturl": "3CE9QB2u",
      "__v": 0
    },
